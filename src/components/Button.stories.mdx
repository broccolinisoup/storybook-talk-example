# Usage

This is our button component. If there is no props given, it renders as a default button (Please see in the stories).
There are also other types of buttons. Simple pass the available options as a `colour` prop (Please have a look at the props table documentation)
for different colours and types.

Buttons are also available in different sizes and front sizes.
Simple pass the available options as a `size` or `fontSize` prop (Please have a look at the props table documentation)
